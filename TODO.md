- [ ] Model inference endpoints
- [ ] Training job management
- [ ] Dataset operations
- [ ] Prompt management system

## Architecture Improvements

### Potential Refactors
- [ ] Consider event-driven architecture for handlers
- [ ] Implement middleware pipeline pattern
- [ ] Add dependency injection (only if complexity grows)
- [ ] Create plugin system for external tools
- [ ] Add request context propagation

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Connection pooling for OAuth requests
- [ ] Implement request batching
- [ ] Add response caching layer
- [ ] Optimize TypeScript compilation
- [ ] Lazy load tool implementations

## Community & Ecosystem

### Documentation
- [ ] Create cookbook with common patterns
- [ ] Build showcase of community tools
- [ ] Write migration guide from other MCP servers
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Add architecture decision records (ADRs)

### Community Building
- [ ] Create Discord/Slack community
- [ ] Monthly virtual meetups
- [ ] Tool sharing marketplace
- [ ] Success story case studies
- [ ] Contributing guidelines

## Security Enhancements

- [ ] Add CORS configuration options
- [ ] Implement API key authentication option
- [ ] Add request signing/verification
- [ ] Security headers middleware
- [ ] Audit logging for sensitive operations
- [ ] Secrets rotation automation

## Monitoring & Observability

- [ ] OpenTelemetry integration
- [ ] Distributed tracing
- [ ] Custom metrics dashboard
- [ ] Error tracking (Sentry integration)
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] SLA tracking

## Nice to Have

- [ ] Web UI for server management
- [ ] GraphQL endpoint option
- [ ] OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- [ ] Postman collection generation
- [ ] VS Code extension for development
- [ ] GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- [ ] Automated dependency updates

## Decision Points

### Should We Add?
1. **Database ORM** - Prisma vs TypeORM vs raw SQL?
2. **Message Queue** - For async operations?
3. **Admin Panel** - For non-technical users?
4. **Multi-tenancy** - Isolated tool sets per tenant?
5. **Billing/Usage Tracking** - For SaaS deployments?

### Technology Choices
- Stick with Express or migrate to Fastify?
- Add tRPC for type-safe APIs?
- Consider Bun runtime for performance?
- Add Zod for runtime validation?
